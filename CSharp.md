# C#

A object oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. Because it's a Microsoft baby, it's .Net compliant.

## .NET

A development platform. A collection of languages, libraries, frameworks that allow for development of different types of apps, like games, webapps, etc.

## SDK vs Runtime

SDK (software development kit) vs runtime. You use SDK to develop (aka write code) and run it. You use runtime to run apps. SDKs have runtime.

## The process of running code

You have a human readable .cs file this gets compiled by .net compiler platform into Intermediate language (IL). This gets compiled by the CLR specifically the JIT compiler into machine/native code. The machine code gets executed by machine.
